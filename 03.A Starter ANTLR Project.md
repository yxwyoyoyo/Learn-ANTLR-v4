# A Starter ANTLR Project

For our first project, let's build a grammar for Java.

In particular, let's recognize integers in, possibly nested, curly braces like `{1, 2, 3}` and `{1, {2, 3}, 4}`. We use this grammar to convert initialized Java short arrays to string.

For example, we cound transform the following:
```java
static short[] data = {1, 2, 3};
```
into the following equivalent string with Unicode constants:
```java
static String data = "\u0001\u0002\u0003"; // Java char are unsigned short
```
where Unicode character specifiers, such as `\u0001`, use four hexadecimal digits representing a 16-bit character value, that is, a `short`.

The reason we might want to do this translation is to overcome a limitation in the Java `.class` file format. A Java class file stores array initializers as a sequence of explicit array-element initializers, equivalent to `data[0]=1; data[1]=2; data[2]=3;`, instead of a compact block of packed bytes. Because Java limits the size of initialization methods, it limits the size of the arrays we can initialize. In contrast, a Java class file stores a string as a contiguous sequence of shorts. Converting array initializers to strings results in a more compact class file and avoids Java’s initialization method size limit.

## The ANTLR Tool, Runtime, and Generated Code

To get started, let's peek inside ANTLR's jar. There are two key ANTLR components: the ANTLR tool itself and the ANTLR runtime (parse-time) API.

The ANTLR tool **generates code (a parser and a lexer) that recognizes sentences in the language described by the grammar**. A lexer breaks up an input stream of characters into tokens and passes them to a parser that checks the syntax.

The ANTLR rumetime is **a library of classes and methods needed by that generated code** such as `Parser`, `Lexer`, and `Token`.

First we run ANTLR on a grammar and then compile the generated code against the runtime classes in the jar. Ultimately, the compiled application runs in conjunction with the runtime classes.

The first step to building a language application is to **create a grammar that describes a language's syntactic rules** (the set of valid sentences). We'll learn how to write grammars in [Designing Grammars](05.Designing%20Grammars.md), but for the moment, here's a grammar that'll do what we want:
```g4
/** Grammars always start with a grammar header. This grammar is called ArrayInit and must match the
 * filename: ArrayInit.g4
 */
grammar ArrayInit;

/** A rule called init that matches comma-separated values between {...}. */
init : '{' value (',' value)* '}'; // must match at least one value

/** A value can be either a nested array/struct or a simple integer (INT) */
value : init | INT;

// parser rules start with lowercase letters, lexer rules with uppercase
INT : [0-9]+ ; // Define token INT as one or more digits
WS : [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip ; // Define whitespace rule, toss it out
```

Then, we can **run ANTLR tool on the grammar file**.
```bash
cd projects/starter
antlr4 ArrayInit.g4 # Generate parser and lexer
```

ANTLR generates lots of files that we'd normally have to write by hand.
![Generated files](images/Generated%20files.png)

Here's a quick description of the generated files:
- `ArrayInitParser.java`: This file contains the parser class definition specific to grammar `ArrayInit` that recognizes our array language syntax.
  ```java
  public class ArrayInitParser extends Parser { ... }
  ```
  It contains a method for each rule in the grammar as well as some support code.
- `ArrayInitLexer.java`: This file contains the lexer class definition specific to grammar `ArrayInit` that analyze the lexical rules INT and WS as well as the grammar literals '{', ',', and '}'.
  ```java
  public class ArrayInitLexer extends Lexer { ... }
  ```
- `ArrayInit.tokens`: ANTLR assigns a token type number to each token we define and stores these values in this file. It’s needed when we split a large grammar into multiple smaller grammars so that ANTLR can synchronize all the token type numbers.
- `ArrayInitListener.java`, `ArrayInitBaseListener.java`: By default, ANTLR parsers build a tree from the input. By walking that tree, a tree walker can fire "events" (callbacks) to a listenser object that we provoide. `ArrayInitListener` is the interface that describes the callbacks we can implementations. `ArrayInitBaseListener` is a set of empty default implementations. This class makes it easy for us to override just the callbacks we're interested in. ANTLR can also generate tree visitors for us with the `-visitor` option.

We'll use the listener classes to translate `short` array initializers to `String` objects shortly, but first let's verify that our parser correctly matches some sample input.

## Testing the Generated Parser

Once we’ve run ANTLR on our grammar, we need to compile the generated Java source code. We can do that by simply compiling everything in our directory.
```bash
cd projects/starter
javac *.java
```

To test our grammar, we can use the `TestRig` within command line.
```bash
# Check out the tokens created by the lexer.
grun ArrayInit init -tokens
# Check out the parse tree generated by parser.
grun ArrayInit init -tree
# Visualize the tree
grun ArrayInit init -gui
```

We can also debug in IDE (VS Code, IDEA) with specify extension.

## Integrating a Generated Parser into a Java Program

Let's look at a simple Java `main()` that invokes our initializer parser and and prints out the parse tree. Here's a boilerplate `ArrayInitTest.java` file that embodies the overall recognizer data flow:
```java
// import ANTLR's runtime libraries
import org.antlr.v4.runtime.*;
import org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.*;

public class ArrayInitTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        System.out.print("Please enter an array initialization expression: ");

        // create a CharStream that reads from standard input
        CharStream stream = CharStreams.fromStream(System.in);

        // create a lexer that feeds off of input CharStream
        ArrayInitLexer lexer = new ArrayInitLexer(stream);

        // create a buffer of tokens pulled from the lexer
        CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);

        // create a parser that feeds off the tokens buffer
        ArrayInitParser parser = new ArrayInitParser(tokens);

        // begin parsing at init rule
        ParseTree tree = parser.init();

        // print LISP-style tree
        System.out.println(tree.toStringTree(parser));
    }
}
```

It just works if syntax is valid.

ANTLR parsers also automatically report and recover from syntax errors.

## Building a Language Application

To move beyond recognition, an application has to extract data from the parse tree. The easiest way to do that is to have ANTLR's built-in parse-tree walker trigger a bunch of callbacks as it performs a depth-first walk.

To write a program that reacts to the input, all we have to do is implement a few methods in a subclass of `ArrayInitBaseListener`. The basic strategy is to have each listener method print out a translated piece of the input when called to do so by the tree walker.

Starting a translation project means figuring out how to convert each input token or phrase to an output string. To do that, it’s a good idea to manually translate a few representative samples in order to pick out the general phrase- to-phrase conversions. In this case, the translation is pretty straightforward.
![ArrayInitTanslate Conversions](images/ArrayInitTranslate%20Conversions.png)

The translation is a series of "X goes to Y" rules.
- Translate `{` to `"`.
- Translate `}` to `"`.
- Translate integers to four-digit hexadecimal strings prefixed with `\u`.

To code the translator, we need to write methods that print out the converted strings upon seeing the appropriate input token or phrase. The built-in tree walker triggers callbacks in a listener upon seeing the beginning and end of the various phrases. Here’s a listener implementation for our translation rules:
```java
public class ShortToUnicodeString extends ArrayInitBaseListener {
    /** Translate { to " */
    @Override
    public void enterInit(ArrayInitParser.InitContext ctx) {
        System.out.print('"');
    }

    /** Translate } to " */
    @Override
    public void exitInit(ArrayInitParser.InitContext ctx) {
        System.out.print('"');
    }

    /** Translate integers to 4-digit hexadecimal strings prefixed with \\u */
    @Override
    public void enterValue(ArrayInitParser.ValueContext ctx) {
        if (ctx.INT() == null) {
            return;
        }

        int value = Integer.valueOf(ctx.INT().getText());
        System.out.printf("\\u%04x", value);
    }
}
```

We don’t need to override every enter/exit method; we do just the ones we care about. The only unfamiliar expression is `ctx.INT()`, which asks the context object for the integer `INT` token matched by that invocation of rule `value`. Context objects record everything that happens during the recognition of a rule.

The only thing left to do is to create a translator application derived from the `ArrayInitTest` boilerplate code shown earlier.
```java
// import ANTLR's runtime libraries
import org.antlr.v4.runtime.*;
import org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.*;

public class ArrayInitTranslate {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        System.out.print("Please enter an array initialization expression: ");

        // create a CharStream that reads from standard input
        CharStream stream = CharStreams.fromStream(System.in);

        // create a lexer that feeds off of input CharStream
        ArrayInitLexer lexer = new ArrayInitLexer(stream);

        // create a buffer of tokens pulled from the lexer
        CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);

        // create a parser that feeds off the tokens buffer
        ArrayInitParser parser = new ArrayInitParser(tokens);

        // begin parsing at init rule
        ParseTree tree = parser.init();

        // create a generic parse tree walker that can trigger callbacks
        ParseTreeWalker walker = new ParseTreeWalker();
        // print a beginning hint
        System.out.print("The translation result is: ");
        // walk the tree created by the parser, trigger callbacks
        walker.walk(new ShortToUnicodeString(), tree);
        // print a \n after translation
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

The only difference from the boilerplate code is that the translator creates a tree walker and asks it to walk the tree returned from the parser. As the tree walker traverses, it triggers calls into our `ShortToUnicodeString` listener.

Run it.
![ArrayInitTranslate Result](images/ArrayInitTranslate%20Result.png)

It works! We’ve just built our first translator, without even touching the grammar. All we had to do was implement a few methods that printed the appropriate phrase translations. Moreover, we can generate completely different output simply by passing in a different listener. Listeners effectively isolate the language application from the grammar, making the grammar reusable for other applications.
