# Welcome Aboard

ANTLR v4 is a powerful parser generator that you can use to read, process, execute, or translate structured text or binary files.

From a formal language description called a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser for that language that can **automatically build parse trees**, which are data structures representing how a grammar matches the input. ANTLR also **automatically generates tree walkers** that you can use to **visit the nodes of those trees to execute application-specific code**.

## What is so cool about ANTLR v4

- ANTLR v4 gladly accepts every grammar you give it. There are no grammar conflict or ambiguity warnings as ANTLR translates your grammar to executable, human-readable parsing code. -- Adaptive LL(*)
- ANTLR v4 dramatically simplifies the grammar rules used to match syntactic structures like programming language arithmetic expressions.
  ```g4
  expr : expr '*' expr // match subexpressions joined with '*' operator
       | expr '+' expr // match subexpressions joined with '+' operator
       | INT // matches simple integer atom
       ;
  ```
- ANTLR v4 is much easier to learn:
  - Deemphasizes embedding actions (code) in the grammar, favoring listeners and visitors instead. The new mechanisms decouple grammars from application code, and you can reuse the same grammar in different applications without even recompiling the generated parser.
  - Because ANTLR automatically generates parse trees and tree walkers. There's no need for you to build tree grammars. You get to use familiar design patterns like the visitor instead. Once you've learned ANTLR grammar syntax, you get to **move back into the comfortable and familiar realm of the programming language to implement the actual language application**.
